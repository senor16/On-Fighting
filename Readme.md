A Fighting game made for the [Game Off 2022](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2022)

## Theme : Clich√©

### How is the theme implemented:

#### 1. Projectile Attack

In every fighting game there have to be a projectile we can throw away to the ennemy: in this game, it's the only way to harm ennemies

#### 2. Block ennemy attack

You have to be able to block ennemies's attack, in this game you can't.  
 You may possibly throw a projectile away so it'll collide with the other one the ennemy has send, That's the only workaround you have.
